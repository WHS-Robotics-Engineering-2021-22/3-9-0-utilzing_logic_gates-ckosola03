The NAND logic gate works in true and false statement. As long as one of the statements comes out as or as long as one of the switches is off the light should be on. Therefore if both of the switches are on then the LED will be off.

The AND logic gate works the opposite of the NAND gate. The statemtnet is only true when both p and q are true. Therefore if both of the switches are on it will work but if one of them or both of them are off the LED wonÂ´t light up.

The NAND logic gate can be used to create other gates and in this demonstration I made a not gate. The not gate only has 2 statements and it is if the imput it true the output is true and if the imput is false than the output is false. The NOT gate works similar to a sitch.
